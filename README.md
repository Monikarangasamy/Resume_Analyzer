1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-resume-analyzer.git
    cd smart-resume-analyzer
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

    *Note: The `requirements.txt` file is not in the source tree, but the dependencies can be inferred from the `app.py` script.*
4.  **Configure your Google API Key**:
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your Google API key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
5.  **Tesseract OCR Setup (Windows only)**:
    If you're using Windows, you must install **Tesseract OCR**.
      - Download and install it from the [Tesseract GitHub page](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
      - Ensure the installation path in `app.py` is correct:
        ```python
        pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
        ```
